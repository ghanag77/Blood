1
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:12,172
- Who's got the scene ?
- Massey and Crutchfield are working it.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,066
Norris is on his way to the morgue.
He'll beat the bodies there.

3
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,942
He's getting the full treatment, boss.

4
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,046
We're good there.

5
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:24,983
Just one witness so far.

6
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:29,538
You know what that means.
Right now it's all BNBG.

7
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,726
It's Andy Kraw's
big adventure.

8
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:35,587
Mayor's office already called twice,
worried sick about the man.

9
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:37,085
You're kidding me.

10
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:39,267
That's a whole lotta
campaign contributions

11
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,267
sitting on the back of that ambo.

12
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:43,017
So what's the scene say ?

13
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:46,266
Two shooters. Shotgun, semiauto.

14
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:49,656
One vic is a West Side soldier
with a pretty healthy sheet

15
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:54,061
the other is a major player
in Daniel's wiretap case.

16
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,152
So a hit.
Drug related.

17
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:58,011
With a big time developer
in the middle ?

18
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,444
What's the fit ?

19
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,659
Second vic, Russell Bell

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,007
owner and co-developer
of this here.

21
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,625
And other downtown
real estate.

22
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,188
Well propertied man,
he was.

23
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,846
But you were aware that Russell Bell

24
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,398
was regarded as a major
narcotic violator.

25
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,284
Well, how do you think
he made his money ?

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,460
I didn't inquire.

27
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:26,038
You never got a look
at either of the gunmen.

28
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:29,961
I told you. I saw only the one of them.
He was black

29
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:34,235
big, I thought,
with a large weapon.

30
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:37,131
BNBG.

31
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,845
Big negro, big gun.

32
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,102
Two more
like it upstairs.

33
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,157
Yeah.

34
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:18,340
Have ballistics rush comparisons.
Drug-relateds for the last six months.

35
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,234
I caught him, Bunk.

36
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:34,727
On the wire. I caught him.

37
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,421
He doesn't
fuckin'know it.

38
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:18,020
Mission Accomplished

39
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,525
Boxing, yeah.

40
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,387
I know
you loved that.

41
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,059
Ugh, I hated it.
I hated watching it.

42
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,520
Yeah,
I know you did.

43
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:34,727
So you're
doing good, huh ?

44
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,177
Day to day, I am.

45
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,036
'Cause I was thinking
maybe...

46
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,770
I'm proud of you, Dennis.
Be well.

47
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:04,910
Shut that
fuckin'door.

48
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,393
Man, fuck it.

49
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,106
I'm ready for this shit.

50
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,643
These niggers are snappin'on us.
You see ?

51
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,918
Do you believe this fucking shit ?

52
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:29,019
Some shit like this woulda never
happened with the old Barksdale.

53
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,525
Yo, Slim, man.
Say the motherfuckin'word.

54
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:40,386
Shit is on.

55
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:49,269
'Sup, B ?

56
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:58,137
You a'ight ?

57
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,953
We gonna bounce back
on the motherfucker, no question.

58
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,227
Bounce back on who ?

59
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,298
Marlo, boss.
Oh, he gonna fall.

60
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,555
Marlo, Marlo ain't got
shit to do with it.

61
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,528
Marlo couldn't
get String like that.

62
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,930
String died'cause of some other shit.

63
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,336
What ?

64
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:17,571
He died because
of some other shit, nigger.

65
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,937
I couldn't fix it.
I tried.

66
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,111
That nigger String was
right about this shit, man.

67
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,045
That nigger was right.

68
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:31,162
Fuck Marlo. Fuck this fucking war.

69
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:34,200
All this beef over
a couple of fuckin'corners.

70
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,811
Don't matter who did
what to who at this point.

71
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,460
Fact is, we went to war

72
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,684
and now there ain't no going back.

73
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,318
I mean, shit

74
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,957
it's what war is, you know.

75
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:49,242
Once you in it, you in it.

76
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:54,121
If it's a lie
then we fight on that lie

77
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,448
but we gotta fight.

78
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,241
Got this out of his pocket.

79
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:09,899
I got no idea.

80
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:12,876
It's a cell chip from a phone.

81
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,526
What elsedid you get off him ?

82
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:19,796
200 cash, set of keys, license.

83
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,225
President Street address ?

84
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,981
I got Landsman bangin'out
a warrant for the place.

85
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,262
Fuck the politics for a minute.

86
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,891
What if the man happens to be right ?

87
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,387
Legalizing drugs ?

88
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,355
Crime is down in his district and

89
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,480
people on that side of town,
they're okay with it.

90
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,968
Look, if you don't exist,
what happens here ?

91
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,237
If there's no Tommy Carcetti

92
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:42,914
in this thing,
what's likely to happen ?

93
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:45,193
The mayor and Burrell,
they shut this thing down.

94
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,888
I figure the Mayor's
trying to find a way

95
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:49,388
to shuit down to make it look like
it was an enforcement plan

96
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,483
in case it goes public

97
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:53,527
otherwise he'd have
moved to end it already.

98
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,212
Makes sense.
But no matter what

99
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:59,270
Colvin's little experiment
is finished.

100
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,145
Come on, Tommy.

101
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:04,266
They dealt you a winning hand

102
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,206
and you're acting like you
forgot how to play.

103
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:13,468
Mr. Mayor, call it legalization
and my office can't live with it.

104
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,218
Agreed.
No one can.

105
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,563
But harm reduction.

106
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:19,643
That could sell provided there's a
reduction in the crime rate.

107
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,189
Harm reduction.
Sounds good.

108
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:25,197
Steven, what if we were
able to suggest

109
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:28,237
limiting our
street level enforcement

110
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:32,236
we were concentrating our resources
on high-level traffickers.

111
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:33,334
How would that play ?

112
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,008
Well, if I could show off that kind
of casework, yeah, maybe.

113
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,308
But they've been doing
street rips for so long now

114
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,830
I don't think
a high level exists.

115
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,148
What if we were able to say
that no major traffickers

116
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,726
were allowed in the free zone--

117
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,556
That the major violators
were still being targeted, huh ?

118
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,070
Are you suggesting
some kind of admissions

119
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:54,065
criteria for the zones ?
How would that work ?

120
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,220
I don't know that it would.

121
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,567
I'm just saying that for
the sake of public perception.

122
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,876
Come on, people,
work with me on this thing.

123
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,647
<i>Fucked up, ain't it ?</i>

124
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:04,444
<i>Marlo need to get his ass
dropped, him and all his crew.</i>

125
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,179
<i>They gonna fall.
You'll see.</i>

126
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,359
<i>All right, let me know.</i>

127
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,730
That's the word
on the wire, anyway.

128
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,961
Every mention puts it
on Marlo Stanfield's crew

129
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,086
which means the war's
gonna ratchet up, no question.

130
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,662
Where's Jimmy ?

131
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:21,638
He went with Bunk Moreland
to rifle Stringer's spot downtown.

132
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:26,046
- How'd he take it ?
- Like Stringer was kin.

133
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:29,348
<i>- Yeah ?
- Bushy Top</i>

134
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,818
<i>- need to pull your coat up.
- Hey, what's up, Major ?</i>

135
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:36,354
<i>I got somethin'for y'all.
Mount Vernon Square in about an hour.</i>

136
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,424
I'm there.

137
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:04,583
This is Stringer's ?

138
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:08,085
Yeah.

139
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,828
Who in fuck was I chasing ?

140
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,969
What's done is done.

141
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,834
Gay ass gangsters.
Please.

142
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,843
I took it for as long as I could.

143
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,095
Let's go, man.

144
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:44,586
Let's go.

145
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:07,353
It being your town, I trust you
to do it proper.

146
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:20,662
You off today, boss ?

147
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,191
Every day, at this point.

148
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:26,206
I told 'em over at COMSTAT
about my little experiment.

149
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,699
Bosses went crazy, huh ?

150
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,898
Anyway, that's why I called you.

151
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,208
That there is a wartime lay-up
for your man Barksdale.

152
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,067
My sources tell me the man's there

153
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:38,775
most of the time
with a lot of muscle :

154
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,238
sawed-offs, semiautos, Mac-11s.

155
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:43,913
Whole lot of good shit
if you hit it right.

156
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:47,014
- That's a hell of a tip.
- Shit.

157
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:51,157
That right there might be
the last bit of police work

158
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:52,554
in a long and storied career.

159
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:55,160
I'll talk to you, Bushy Top.

160
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:03,913
Which one is Ali ?

161
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,667
In the white trunks, boy.

162
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,133
- Damn, he look young.
- He was.

163
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,736
This the Patterson fight
right here. Old school.

164
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:14,130
Who Patterson ?
He soft.

165
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:16,088
Ali whippin'his ass.

166
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:18,004
He was a champ too.

167
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,899
Look, any man still standing
at the end of a round

168
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:24,093
you can't call him soft.
That's a rule, all right ?

169
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,844
From Stringer's place downtown.

170
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,489
B and B shit, college papers,
real estate stuff.

171
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,719
There's no phone extension
in the place, just these.

172
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,091
Cell phone chips.'Bout 100 of them.

173
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:43,396
So that's why he wasn't
taking any phones

174
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,769
from our man Bernard, huh ?

175
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:45,947
Stringer had his own phone

176
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:48,392
he just changed the number every
time he changed the chip.

177
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:51,161
Shamrock too, probably, with
whatever phone he used to call Bell.

178
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:52,036
Cautious man.

179
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,557
Yes and no.

180
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,313
Have a look in here.
All different manufacturers.

181
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,149
Before Stringer Bell got aced

182
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:10,946
he went out of his way to put in
his good friend Avon Barksdale.

183
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:14,214
That's a Barksdale safe house.

184
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,201
Where'd you get this ?

185
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:22,398
Colvin.

186
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:26,740
- Calls to the Western.
- Where's Daniels ?

187
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,228
He's got this thing downtown.
It's for his wife.

188
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:31,718
You should raise him.

189
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:36,161
It's not enough
to make up for Stringer.

190
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:38,937
It'll do for now.

191
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:42,458
Because the neighborhoods

192
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,592
and the residents
in this district are among

193
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,614
the poorest in our city.
And it is these residents

194
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:50,689
who most need
a strong voice at City Hall.

195
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:53,135
Time has come for a change.

196
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,906
<i>And I believe I can
bring about that change</i>

197
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:00,178
<i>by providing a strong voice
for the new 11th District</i>

198
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:02,840
<i>if you will do me the honor--</i>

199
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:05,893
It's kind of cool, the lieutenant's wife
running for office, you know.

200
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:10,185
<i>Well, as you just heard,
West Baltimore City</i>

201
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:13,208
<i>Council woman Eunetta Perkins
is going to have her hands full</i>

202
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:15,198
<i>in next September's
Democratic finals.</i>

203
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:18,619
Stringer Bell.
Damn.

204
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,395
Who could have got to him ?

205
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,664
I mean, if it wasn't y'all on it.

206
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,986
You know Avon's gonna
put it on you, right ?

207
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:28,103
Shit, let him take it
on my jacket.

208
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,607
Don't make me no never mind.

209
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,695
I'm thinkin'it might be what
you call one of them good problems.

210
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:35,042
Yeah.

211
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,215
I heard Colvin's
in deep shit downtown.

212
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:45,650
Looking at this right here

213
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,215
he might not be the only one.

214
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,613
Anything comes up,
I'm on the radio.

215
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,199
My man, my man, my man.
Yo, you think I could get like $5 ?

216
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,079
- I need like $5 to get on the bus.
- I look like a tourist to you ?

217
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,483
- Man, I swear to God.
- Lookin'like that

218
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:05,097
walking into
an open-air drug market

219
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,134
why the hell would
I think you'll spend my $5

220
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:08,343
on bus fare ?

221
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:12,188
Shit,'cause I already
got my blast, man.

222
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:10,513
All night you been drinking
like your ass is candy.

223
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:12,949
That's shameful shit.

224
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:20,973
12-gauge pumpkin balls.

225
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:27,297
Last time I saw that kind of load
was the Pimlico double

226
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:31,805
and I fuckin'know that motherfucker
was in the middle of that mess.

227
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,867
And if I remember your boy

228
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:37,719
he had no love
for the Barksdale people.

229
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:40,349
Execution style, that don't play
like Omar Little.

230
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:45,394
Besides, the word on our wire
is that Marlo's people did Stringer.

231
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,599
- Marlo Stanfield ?
- The heir apparent.

232
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,638
This city's going to hell, man.

233
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,912
We're gonna push past 300 murders
before New Year's.

234
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,884
Shit is fucked.

235
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:05,275
Oh, hey, Cheryl.

236
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,500
No ? My guess is she's, uh,
picking up a prisoner.

237
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,038
Yeah, I spoke to her
about ten minutes ago.

238
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,966
Yeah, well, they make you
check your stuff.

239
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:18,675
Cell phone, money, weapon.

240
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,659
Well, she'll call
when she gets the message.

241
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,183
Not at all.

242
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:27,198
I need more, Jimmy.

243
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,694
More !

244
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:46,893
Motherfucker.

245
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,166
I'm tired, Bunk.

246
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,088
Let's go.

247
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,473
I heard the vanguard met.

248
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:07,769
Heard they voted to have a
civilian review board look at it.

249
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,725
It wasn't unanimous. And there were
people there speaking for you.

250
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,253
I heard that too.

251
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,911
So six out of ten black officers
think I'm just an asshole racist.

252
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,179
On the other hand

253
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,537
four out of ten
think you're just an asshole.

254
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:32,001
It's an administrative charge.
You can fight it and win

255
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,163
if you want.

256
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:36,672
Failure to properly identify myself
as a police officer.

257
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,307
Sounds like what I was guilty of
most of my career, actually.

258
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:46,579
I'm not sure
I was supposed to be a police.

259
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:50,144
Not really.

260
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,779
What were ya supposed to be, huh ?

261
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,255
This is from Major Colvin's CI ?

262
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:05,348
What's the corroboration ?

263
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:09,120
Well, the source knew that Barksdale
had a waterfront condo in his own name

264
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,443
gave the accurate location,
and title info

265
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:12,931
down to deed of transfer.

266
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,462
Well, that's good, but it puts him on
the legitimate side of things.

267
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,074
What corroboration is there
for illegal activities ?

268
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,796
Sorry I'm late.

269
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,212
I had to stop in at a friend.

270
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,424
The source knew that Barksdale
was shot last month

271
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:26,491
wounded in the shoulder.

272
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:29,204
- Emergency room ?
- No, no hospital reports.

273
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,564
We're gonna need better.

274
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:34,779
Either Colvin goes back to the CI
or we sit on this address for a while.

275
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:37,246
- we can see.
- Well, fuck it, then.

276
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,226
Let's name the source.
Put him right in the affidavit.

277
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:42,658
- It's Colvin's call, isn't it ?
- It's Stringer Bell.

278
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,865
Lester figured it out from the DNRs.

279
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:49,707
Bell was snitching out Barksdale.

280
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:52,628
- You're sure of this ?
- Maybe that explains the murder.

281
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:53,837
What's in the wire ?

282
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,296
Loose talk about how
it was Marlo's people

283
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:58,190
but nothing past rumor.

284
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,943
With Bell gone, Barksdale might
have to come down a notch

285
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,895
to oversee the day to day, and
maybe that puts him in contact

286
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:06,251
with some of our
monitored cell phones.

287
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,227
If he's as cautious
as Stringer, maybe not.

288
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:12,330
My guess is Barksdale
never touches a cell phone.

289
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:14,622
Safe house might be our best shot.

290
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,137
All right.

291
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:20,167
We stay on the wires until
this batch of burners

292
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:22,373
goes dead, hoping
we have Barksdale

293
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,036
but meanwhile, we get a warrant

294
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,877
for that safe house
and wait on him there.

295
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,777
Thanks for the cover last night.

296
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,471
This is Greggs, Major Case Unit.
Who's the shift leader ?

297
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:20,896
Holy Christ.

298
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:37,312
<i>- They're all over it, Commissioner.
- Right</i>

299
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:41,112
That was Foxtrot.

300
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:43,768
The cameras have found our
little shit pile.

301
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:46,653
Your fuckin'councilman
took his sweet time, didn't he ?

302
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,860
Everyone's a critic.

303
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:53,945
If this doesn't go, what line
of work are you gonna try next ?

304
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,938
We're here in West Baltimore--

305
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:05,784
For more than a month, police
from Baltimore's Western District.

306
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:07,601
It's just an outrageous development.

307
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,635
It's something I never thought I'd see
from this or any other administration.

308
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,271
Frankly, this is one of the
reasons we need a change

309
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,426
in leadership in this city.

310
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:23,877
Did the Mayor know ?
What about the Police Commissioner ?

311
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:26,356
These are questions for the
Mayor and Police Commissioner.

312
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,337
These are central issues
of crime and safety.

313
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:30,252
The Royce administration
is simply bankrupt.

314
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,365
You still gonna announce
for mayor next month ?

315
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:34,147
Standing here today
looking at this ?

316
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:36,822
I can't see I can do anything
but put it out there right now.

317
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,231
All I can tell you is that
for more than four weeks now

318
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,109
the Baltimore Police
Department surrendered

319
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:43,184
portions of the police district
to the drug trade

320
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:44,842
and the Council was not informed.

321
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:49,091
Fuck me. I fuckin' had this story
all to myself a week ago.

322
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:52,314
<i>Police officers for weeks
have turned a blind eye...</i>

323
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:54,367
What the fuck was I thinking ?

324
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:58,035
<i>..sanctioning open-air
drug markets.</i>

325
00:24:58,846 --> 00:24:59,590
'Scuse us.

326
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:05,101
<i>...in the so called free zones,
drug dealers routinely ply...</i>

327
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:07,122
Mr. Mayor,
Commissioner Burrell is here.

328
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,812
Tell the Commissioner the Mayor
will be with him shortly.

329
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:12,263
<i>And young children run
the streets alone.</i>

330
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:15,151
<i>The inhabitants of what
has come to be known</i>

331
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,676
<i>as Hampsterdam have little
to say for the camera.</i>

332
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,793
<i>But channel 5 has learned
that the police were...</i>

333
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:23,809
Yeah ?

334
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,050
<i>What are you seein'?</i>

335
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,995
Coupla people in and out.
No sign of Barksdale, though.

336
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:29,355
<i>It's quiet here too.</i>

337
00:25:29,618 --> 00:25:30,668
Okay.

338
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:32,801
Need to look at the back.

339
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,761
Our friend Carcetti's gonna
run wild with this.

340
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:39,756
And from the sound of things,
Gray is gonna run with him.

341
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:43,010
Tony Gray thinks he's gonna
get my chair behind this bullshit

342
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,659
We're throwin'you out
of the boat, Ervin.

343
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,030
This shit is on you alone.

344
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:51,477
Not necessarily.

345
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:54,000
Not if I talk about how
we were under pressure

346
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:55,371
to keep the crime down

347
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,554
to juke the stats
district by district...

348
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:58,827
You never said that.

349
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:02,010
About how Colvin under pressure,
lost his way

350
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,764
about how I came to you
weeks ago...

351
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:05,558
- Days ago.
- Weeks ago

352
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,963
to tell you what he had
done and to assure you that

353
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,858
we were on top of the situation

354
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:13,078
that Colvin would be relieved
and his plan aborted.

355
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,892
You lyin'motherfucker.

356
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:18,218
But you heard about the drop
in Colvin's felony rate

357
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:20,080
and you sent me packing.

358
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,993
Brought in your liberal-ass
do-gooders to seriously consider

359
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:25,632
this horseshit

360
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,227
while Colvin's
mistake grew and grew.

361
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:31,727
My hands were tied, Mr. Mayor

362
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:34,410
my department thwarted.

363
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:38,221
I was a prisoner
of the goddamn politicians.

364
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:40,007
Or...

365
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:48,502
I leave your office right now
willing to say a lot less than that.

366
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,822
I put what I can
on crazy-ass Bunny Colvin

367
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:57,526
and I take the hit.
And if Carcetti or Gray holds hearings

368
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,724
I'm the wall between them and you.

369
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,901
In which case, I am your commissioner

370
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:08,955
for the full five-year term.

371
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,005
Unit one to unit two.

372
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:25,070
- Unit two standing by.
- Deal's made.

373
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:30,528
Unit two to sector three,
move on the Winchester Homes.

374
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:32,303
<i>Ten-four. We're moving.</i>

375
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:34,109
Unit two to sector two.

376
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:35,740
Move on the Koppers plant.

377
00:27:35,844 --> 00:27:36,918
<i>Roger that.</i>

378
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,190
Over the top, gentlemen.

379
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,616
'Bout fucking time.

380
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:18,640
Man, g outaigo re-up.

381
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:21,712
- Where Tuckie at ?
- I don't know.

382
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:28,148
- Yo, where Tuckie at, man ?
- He rolled out.

383
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,122
- He said the police comin'.

384
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:38,406
- D'oh.
- Here they come. Let's roll.

385
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,931
Hold it right there

386
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:15,240
White jacket !
Stop right there ! Stop !

387
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:24,256
Freeze ! Police, don't move !

388
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:29,336
<i>Outstanding, red team.
Oustanding.</i>

389
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:31,449
<i>Give you a case
of beer for that one.</i>

390
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:53,985
Son, this nigga Stringer Bell, man

391
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,364
was beggin'Chris, yo, for real.

392
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:57,768
Like know what I mean ?

393
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,394
Diggin'in his pockets,
talkin' 'bout how much cheese

394
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:03,311
he gonna give us, I mean,
if we just let him walk.

395
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:06,188
My man Chris holler,
"Man, bitch, you gonna die."

396
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:08,594
This nigga just dropped
to his fuckin' knees like

397
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,355
a little cocksucker,
man, start cryin'.

398
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,568
That shit was worse
than fuckin' pathetic.

399
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:20,020
- Yo, that's Marlo.
- Get on yo'burner, man.

400
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,191
<i>- Got a line on him.
- The number one ? Where at ?</i>

401
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:32,554
<i>Tall man says
to tell y'all to soldier up.</i>

402
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:35,685
<i>They up at the rim shop.</i>

403
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:40,738
- Boss, you okay ?
- What you want ?

404
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,229
Slim said they got
their eye on Marlo.

405
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,760
I'm just sayin', you know,
all the boys, they all waitin'on you.

406
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,470
Go ahead, man.

407
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,108
I'm behind you.

408
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,380
What else you need
from us, Deputy ?

409
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,259
City Hall wants
the bulldozers through here

410
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:21,529
at dawnand then fencing
all around the site.

411
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:23,927
Winchester Homes
and the Koppers plant as well.

412
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,781
We got it.

413
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,553
Come tomorrow,
the television reporters

414
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,988
get nothing they can
stand in front of.

415
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,314
'Scuse me, Deputy,
sir, we found a body.

416
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,108
Any trauma ?

417
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:50,067
Can't tell for sure
with all the rat bites.

418
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,147
Take him to OCME
in a jail wagon.

419
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:56,019
I don't want the fuckin'
reporters seeing any ambos.

420
00:31:57,842 --> 00:31:58,937
Shit.

421
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:12,554
<i>He just landed. Him plus one.</i>

422
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:14,496
Got it. Sit tight.

423
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:15,658
That makes how many ?

424
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:20,496
Including Barksdale, Sydnor
counted ten in

425
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:22,645
and one comin'out,
so that's ten at least.

426
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:28,865
2301 to KGA.

427
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,018
<i>Go ahead, 2301.</i>

428
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:35,686
We need QRT to meet us at our 20
for a search and seizure.

429
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:39,602
Location has multiple suspects
and may contain automatic weapons.

430
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:40,653
<i>Ten-four.</i>

431
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,615
Word travels fast, huh ?

432
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:52,620
Shit.

433
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,592
Burrell called Johns Hopkins
personally this morning.

434
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:03,302
Dragged your name into the gutter.

435
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:05,536
Johns Hopkins doesn't
need the notoriety.

436
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:08,631
The chief academic officer of a
major research university

437
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,643
doesn't want to hear
that some new hire

438
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:12,461
makes up the rules
as he goes along.

439
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:19,522
Yeah, Colvin.

440
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,222
COMSTAT tomorrow.

441
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:33,814
I'm up.

442
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:42,330
Y'all taking a door ?

443
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:43,992
Where's tactical ?

444
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,433
I called for QRT.

445
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:47,983
You ain't heard ?

446
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,722
They're a little busy tonight
tearin'down Colvin's fuck up.

447
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,754
With all that goin'on,
you're lucky you even got us.

448
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:56,928
- Who he hittin' on this ?
- Avon Barksdale and crew.

449
00:33:57,111 --> 00:34:00,629
I fuckin' told you he was out.
Did i fuckin' tell you ?

450
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:03,207
I fuckin' told her.

451
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,787
<i>For more than four weeks,
the Baltimore Police Department...</i>

452
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,061
By tomorrow, the story goes national
and Washington reacts.

453
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:15,149
Save the best
questions for Tony Gray.

454
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,370
He needs to shine
even more than you.

455
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:29,239
I can't believe
he wants us to knock.

456
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,090
Well, you can' flush
guns, now, can you ?

457
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,172
Well, fuck that.
What if they open up on us ?

458
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,224
These guys are
at war with another crew.

459
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,932
We go chargin'in there,
chances are we will get lit up.

460
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:53,788
Yo, B.

461
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:57,222
Sham sayin'that Charles
sayin'they still up at the rim shop.

462
00:34:57,365 --> 00:35:00,357
Marlo, his boy Chris,
and Vinson, they still eatin'

463
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:02,999
but the rest of the muscle,
they rolled out.

464
00:35:12,214 --> 00:35:12,872
<i>Police !</i>

465
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:15,200
No.

466
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,427
Not the police.

467
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,330
- Narco's out back too.
- Shit.

468
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:24,242
<i>Let us in !
We know you're in there.</i>

469
00:35:27,113 --> 00:35:29,322
<i>Open the door,
you fucking cocksuckers !</i>

470
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,347
Fucked up, man.

471
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:32,160
Y'all ask me

472
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:34,835
y'all ugly ass niggers
shouldn't be in here

473
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:36,639
fucking around
with all these guns and shit

474
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,064
Open it.

475
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,795
<i>Come on, Avon. Enough with this shit.
Open the fucking door.</i>

476
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:54,145
<i>Open the fucking door,
you cocksuckers.</i>

477
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,862
Police !

478
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,262
- Search warrant !
- I'm clean, man.

479
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:05,325
<i>Open the fucking door.</i>

480
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,430
Get down !

481
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:11,500
Face that shit tight. Greggs.

482
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,980
I'm opening up.

483
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:21,439
That'd be mine.

484
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:23,246
In fact,
all that's mine.

485
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:25,959
You got a law degree ?

486
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,580
Take him.

487
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,956
You fall on the parole violation.
No matter whatever else happens

488
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:35,937
you do every day of
what's left of your seven

489
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:36,857
without seeing a jury.

490
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:39,002
Maybe even conspiracy to murder.

491
00:36:39,017 --> 00:36:42,678
We take this federal, see if we can
get you ten to life... no parole.

492
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:44,962
Whatever.

493
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:48,284
Shit, you only do two days no how.

494
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:51,793
- That's the day you go in.
- And the day you come out.

495
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,220
Yeah, well, here's the warrant.

496
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,042
You read it slow.

497
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:06,771
In between them two days,
give you something to think on.

498
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:26,963
Damn.

499
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:28,877
Missed our shot.

500
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:31,215
Roll, man.

501
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:36,413
You bend over for us,
or I swear to God

502
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:38,145
I will spend what's
left of my career

503
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:40,692
shitting on every last
supervisor in your district.

504
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,404
From shift commanders down
to sector sergeants, not one of them

505
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:46,906
will have any rank at all if we
hear so much as a bark out of you.

506
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:49,652
Look, my people saw this as a
tactical deployment only.

507
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,514
The responsibility is mine alone.

508
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:53,415
Well, you won't fall alone

509
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:57,506
unless you're willing to fall exactly
as we want you to.

510
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,888
After COMSTAT,
you go to retirement services

511
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,665
and drop papers, going out
at a lieutenant's grade

512
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:06,967
That's right, you're busted back.
We can't take your EOD away

513
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:09,314
but you're not going out
on a major's pay.

514
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:11,272
I can retire before you bust me.

515
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,564
I got vacation time
enough to make my 30.

516
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,863
Fuck your vacation time.

517
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:19,540
You're out today, at the lower grade.

518
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,744
That's against the goddamn contract.

519
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,956
What part of bend over
didn't you understand ?

520
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:28,866
Avon locked up ?

521
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,601
With most of his muscle, yeah.

522
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,084
Good day to get back out
on them corners, ain't it ?

523
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:36,697
Make some money.

524
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,050
You bet.

525
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,842
It's not just the 17 millions
in federal funding

526
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:53,481
for Baltimore law enforcement
that you've jeopardized.

527
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:56,484
Take off another 200 million of federal
money in your operating budget

528
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,035
another 75 in capital expenditures,

529
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:02,529
plus untold millions in pass-through
federal dollars from Annapolis.

530
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:05,441
All told, we're talking about

531
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,600
half a billion a year that Baltimore
will be doing without.

532
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:11,433
Furthermore, the U.S. Attorney here
will use all the resources

533
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:13,724
of the Justice Department
to interdict and destroy

534
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,410
any attempt to establish

535
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:19,072
a geographic entity
where drugs are legal.

536
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:22,192
Washington should know that
what happened in West Baltimore

537
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:25,391
in no way reflects the policies
of my administration.

538
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:27,371
That was an aberration,
Mr. Talmadge.

539
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:29,664
The work of one
misguided police official.

540
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,669
We understand your concerns

541
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:34,979
but for the deputy drug czar

542
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,613
to take the time out
to drive 30 miles north

543
00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:40,080
to deliver that message,
hardly necessary.

544
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:43,533
Rest assured.

545
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,080
What up, G ?

546
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,944
Where the older ones at ?

547
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:54,351
Marlo got his package back out.

548
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,593
Fire Burrell.
This nonsense began in his shop

549
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,521
without him knowing it.
Fire the man and move on.

550
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:14,171
Odell, I respect your opinion.

551
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,034
But right now

552
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:19,956
Tony Gray, Carcetti maneuvering

553
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:22,360
now is not the time.

554
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:27,002
We get past the primary, then I'll drive
a stake in his heart.

555
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:28,639
But right now
I need him where he is

556
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:29,983
for no other reason than to

557
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:32,164
well, to take the hit
for this thing right here.

558
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,953
But I tell you what
I'm gonna do, though.

559
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:36,739
I'm gonna shine on that new girl
you like in the 11th.

560
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:40,259
Give her a spot on the ticket.
Cut Eunetta loose.

561
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:41,348
Eunetta's had her day.

562
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:46,264
I respect the fact that
you stood by me, Odell.

563
00:40:46,304 --> 00:40:47,611
I respect loyalty.

564
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,758
And did so without properly
informing his superior officers

565
00:40:53,432 --> 00:40:56,584
and without regard to the criminal
statutes he was sworn to enforce

566
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:59,918
thereby disgracing himself
and his command.

567
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,988
Is any of that subject
to any contradiction

568
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,355
or argument whatsoever,
Major Colvin ?

569
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:08,257
No, sir.

570
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:09,975
No argument at all, Bunny ?

571
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,147
Not much you can say, is there ?

572
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:13,835
Not to real police.

573
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:16,910
- Get on with it,motherfu--
- 'Scuse me, major ?

574
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,306
Is the admin lieutenant present ?

575
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,165
Major Colvin is relieved of duty.

576
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:28,340
You are now the acting commander
of the Western District.

577
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,989
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, Freamon.

578
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:07,630
- Who is that ? Crutchfield ?

579
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,254
- Naw, Norris.

580
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:10,933
Sleeping on a stakeout.

581
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:13,413
<i>Damn, Bernard, didn't I tell
you about these guys ?</i>

582
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:18,676
Yeah, that's everyone
we heard on the wire.

583
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,812
McNulty's over there in number
one with Pearlman.

584
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,472
Why don't you say hey ?

585
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:29,130
You got to be
the stupidest motherfucker

586
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:31,024
that I've ever gone out with.

587
00:42:31,327 --> 00:42:33,157
I can't wait to go to jail.

588
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:35,727
What ? What you say ?

589
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:38,361
What the fuck did you say, Bernard ?

590
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:50,870
Hey, Donald.

591
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,906
- You heard the tapes.
- Look, he came to me

592
00:42:58,024 --> 00:43:00,648
and said we could sell drugs
if we move down to Vincent Street

593
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:02,028
and that's where I moved my crew.

594
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,929
And you know I did because you the one
that popped me with the G-pack

595
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,404
on my way to the spot,
and let me go, remember ?

596
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,309
You were selling drugs
in Major Colvin's free zone ?

597
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:12,974
- You can prove that.
- Ask him. He know.

598
00:43:13,762 --> 00:43:15,927
This must be one of them
contrapment things.

599
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:17,626
You mean entrapment.

600
00:43:17,627 --> 00:43:20,025
Kid's got a point.

601
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:29,470
19 in bracelets
from Barksdale on down.

602
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:31,197
Another eight wanted on warrants.

603
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:35,009
Any way you can tie your case
to this mess with Colvin ?

604
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,150
Make it like what he was
doing led to your thing ?

605
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:39,139
I don't see it.

606
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:43,521
Well, it's good work
nonetheless, Major Daniels.

607
00:43:46,778 --> 00:43:48,911
Call came in from the Mayor's office

608
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:51,943
half hour ago
approving your promotion.

609
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:54,802
And now with Colvin,
there's a new vacancy.

610
00:43:57,393 --> 00:43:59,813
- What about my wife ?
- What about her ?

611
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:02,415
The Mayor. Eunetta's seat.

612
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,687
- Why would the Mayor...
- Good police work maybe.

613
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:11,017
Not everything is politics.

614
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,574
Hey, I'll take two. Western alumni.

615
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,982
All right, you got it.

616
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:20,593
Major.

617
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:24,020
I heard.

618
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,570
How's your family take it ?

619
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,103
Lolita done dropped herself
30 pounds and got herself

620
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:37,484
a real estate license

621
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:40,674
so I guess she's fixin'to leave me.

622
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:52,531
I just wanted you to know
that last tip you gave me

623
00:44:52,532 --> 00:44:53,876
was a winner.

624
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,603
Yeah, I heard.

625
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,015
That's good work.

626
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:03,687
Also, I don't know if you know,
Stringer Bell was shot to death

627
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:04,770
two days ago.

628
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:09,926
So anyway,
I put his name on the paper

629
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:11,172
to tighten the PC.

630
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:15,648
I figured what the fuck
once he's aced, right ?

631
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:21,504
You always did cut
them corners, didn't you ?

632
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:29,215
Seems like you cut a few
yourself, Major.

633
00:45:33,305 --> 00:45:35,247
However it ends,
you're good police.

634
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,149
I just did what I did.

635
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:39,932
It felt right.

636
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:43,781
I'm fine with that.

637
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:28,813
I don't understand.

638
00:46:32,024 --> 00:46:33,019
Drink your wine.

639
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:40,869
You and me in public.

640
00:46:43,023 --> 00:46:45,245
- But your wife.
- She wins without me.

641
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:52,137
On the Mayor's ticket, she wins.

642
00:46:52,198 --> 00:46:53,360
And you make major ?

643
00:46:56,326 --> 00:46:58,956
I think she was waiting for this day
more than I ever was.

644
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:02,445
And now she's not here.

645
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,645
No.

646
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:07,159
She's not.

647
00:47:15,024 --> 00:47:16,382
From out of nowhere, huh ?

648
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,758
Nowhere is right.

649
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:21,733
Why me ?

650
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,517
I guess you don't live right.

651
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,495
- Kari, what was that ?
- Nothing.

652
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:35,068
- What broke ?
- Nothing, Mama.

653
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:43,005
So...

654
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,628
Yeah.

655
00:47:45,877 --> 00:47:47,708
You just drive over here.

656
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:48,957
I did.

657
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:53,015
Why tonight ? What happened ?

658
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:58,401
I was in my old district tonight

659
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:00,834
which is where I used
to feel pretty good, I think.

660
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:03,651
I wasn't so angry
when I was there anyway.

661
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,504
I don't know, someone said
something, I guess

662
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:10,856
and, uhit doesn't make sense.

663
00:48:14,535 --> 00:48:15,936
I guess I finished something today.

664
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:17,469
A case ?

665
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:19,638
More than that.

666
00:48:21,887 --> 00:48:23,654
It's like everything
I poured into a glass

667
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:25,269
came out the bottom

668
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,094
and I just kept on pouring.

669
00:48:28,445 --> 00:48:30,425
Like the thing had
a hole in it, you know.

670
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:33,740
Things that make me right
for this job

671
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:35,766
maybe they're the same things
that make me wrong

672
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:37,333
for everything else.

673
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:40,787
Do you want to come inside
for a drink ?

674
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:45,906
Not tonight.

675
00:48:49,787 --> 00:48:51,649
But if it's not too late,
I wouldn't mind

676
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:52,881
meeting your kids.

677
00:49:52,003 --> 00:49:55,130
Major Colvin misled his officers.

678
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:58,938
They thought that his initiative
was a tactical deployment

679
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,300
to entrap narcotics traffickers.

680
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:04,063
There was no mention whatsoever

681
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:06,792
of the initiative to
any superior officer.

682
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:09,687
And for five weeks, all evidence

683
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:12,681
of what he was doing managed to elude
the entire command staff.

684
00:50:14,105 --> 00:50:15,472
Are you kidding, Commissioner ?

685
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,984
I take full responsibility

686
00:50:17,304 --> 00:50:20,153
and indeed, after I first learned
of the matter

687
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:22,323
I informed the Mayor, and together

688
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:23,781
we moved immediately

689
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:26,869
to relieve Major Colvin

690
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:28,502
I'm under the impression that

691
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:30,725
this administration
gave serious consideration

692
00:50:30,738 --> 00:50:32,314
with Colvin's initiative.

693
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:33,491
No, sir.

694
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:36,093
Major Colvin informed you of his effort
at a COMSTAT meeting

695
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:37,430
more than a week ago.

696
00:50:37,438 --> 00:50:39,674
His free zones stayed up
for six days after that.

697
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:42,300
That's my responsibility, Councilman.

698
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:44,648
We needed the time to conclude
an ongoing investigation

699
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,839
by the Major Crime Unit,
a wiretap case

700
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,841
that would have been disrupted

701
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:51,952
Correct, Mayor Royce was aware
of the pending case

702
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:55,191
and allowed us to delay
our response accordingly.

703
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:57,475
But the Mayor was unequivocal

704
00:50:57,689 --> 00:51:00,634
in his opposition
to what Major Colvin did.

705
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:03,494
What we have here, I'm afraid,
is nothing more complicated

706
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:06,554
than a solitary police commander
who, under great pressure

707
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:10,916
proved to be amoral, incompetent,
and unfit for command.

708
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,054
No.

709
00:51:13,748 --> 00:51:14,847
It's about more than that.

710
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:17,417
This is more important
than who knew what when

711
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:19,438
or who falls on his sword

712
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:21,706
or whether someone
can use this disaster

713
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,481
to make a political point or two.

714
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:24,420
Mr. Chairman--

715
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:27,340
We can forgive Major Colvin who,
out of his frustration

716
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:29,921
and despair, found himself
condoning something which

717
00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:33,420
can't possibly be condoned.
We can do that much.

718
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:37,414
But, gentlemen, what we can't forgive,

719
00:51:37,573 --> 00:51:40,235
what I can't forgive ever

720
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:42,451
is how we...

721
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,634
you, me, this administration,
all of us

722
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:52,643
how we turned away from those streets
in West Baltimore. The poor, the sick

723
00:51:52,892 --> 00:51:56,401
the swollen underclass of our city
trapped in the wreckage of neighborhoods

724
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:59,186
which were once so prized.
Communities which

725
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,226
we've failed to defend,
which we have surrendered

726
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,430
to the horrors of the drug trade.

727
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:07,629
And if this disaster demands anything
of us as a city

728
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:09,786
it demands that we say enough.

729
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,770
Enough to the despair which makes
policemen even think about surrender.

730
00:52:12,778 --> 00:52:15,213
Enough to the fact that
these neighborhoods are not saved

731
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,722
or are beyond the saving.
Enough to this administration's

732
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:21,015
indecisiveness and lethargy

733
00:52:21,385 --> 00:52:23,544
to the garbage
which goes uncollected

734
00:52:23,592 --> 00:52:25,995
the lots and row houses
which stay vacant

735
00:52:26,162 --> 00:52:28,279
the addicts who go untreated

736
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:30,050
the working men and women
who every day

737
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:31,884
are denied a chance
at economic freedom.

738
00:52:34,712 --> 00:52:36,473
Enough to the crime,
which every day

739
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:38,952
chokes more and more
of the life from our city.

740
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:41,668
And...

741
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,062
the thing of it is, if we don't
take responsibility and step up

742
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:48,448
not just for the mistakes
and the miscues

743
00:52:48,638 --> 00:52:51,505
but for whether or not we're gonna
win this battle for our streets

744
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:52,535
if that doesn't happen

745
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,972
we're gonna lose these neighborhoods
and ultimately this city forever.

746
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,853
If we don't have the courage

747
00:52:57,877 --> 00:53:00,912
and the conviction to fight this war
they way it should be fought

748
00:53:00,913 --> 00:53:03,471
the way it needs to be fought,
using every weapon

749
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:06,495
that we can possibly muster,
if that doesn't happen

750
00:53:08,548 --> 00:53:10,126
well, then we're staring at defeat.

751
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:14,882
And that defeat
should not and cannot

752
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:16,911
and will not be forgiven.

753
00:53:25,191 --> 00:53:26,253
It was a good case

754
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,961
I'm not denying that

755
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,582
but I need to trust my people.

756
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:34,235
Unless you can give
your word, there's no way--

757
00:53:34,434 --> 00:53:36,518
That's more than fair.

758
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:38,540
Thanks.

759
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:41,524
But it's better for me
if I do something else.

760
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:47,317
Detective.

761
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:51,107
It's not you, it's me.

762
00:53:53,286 --> 00:53:55,694
- But where--
- The western, I think.

763
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:59,384
Western feels like home.

764
00:54:13,737 --> 00:54:15,894
You showed something today.

765
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,063
Just felt like it needed to be said.

766
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:23,387
Sounds like you're
running for something.

767
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:28,167
Eunetta.

768
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:29,941
Been a while.

769
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,646
Thought y'all was in training.

770
00:55:02,534 --> 00:55:05,042
So what time you want us to be
there tomorrow, coach ?

771
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,608
3:30 would be good.

772
00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:10,406
- Hope to see you all then.
- A'right.

773
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:29,266
What the fuck y'all
standing around for ?

774
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:31,050
Man, get to work.

775
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:37,138
That's a seed.

776
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:39,528
Yeah.

777
00:59:59,056 --> 01:00:00,614
What do you see right here?

778
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:03,693
It's bulk metal. 10¢ a pound.

779
01:00:04,086 --> 01:00:04,499
Here.

780
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,252
Aluminum.

781
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:08,738
Right you are. 30¢ a pound

782
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:11,308
no problem.

783
01:00:12,223 --> 01:00:15,884
in these modern times a man
gotta keep one eye on the ground

784
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:17,849
pick up what he find, feel me ?

785
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,738
There's money to be made
if you know where to look.

786
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:25,131
I hope you listenin','cause
I'm tryin'to school you here.

787
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,329
Yeah, you don't want to know.

788
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,565
You see, You think you brown,
but you still green.

789
01:00:39,133 --> 01:00:39,968
How ya doin'?

790
01:00:45,906 --> 01:00:46,962
That's somethin', huh ?

791
01:00:47,504 --> 01:00:50,416
It's like they took a big
eraserand rubbed across it.

792
01:00:51,978 --> 01:00:52,483
Yaeh !

793
01:00:55,675 --> 01:00:58,189
Yeah, but before a dope
fiend come down here

794
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:01,982
cop a little somethin',
ain't nary a soul hassle him.

795
01:01:02,687 --> 01:01:05,494
Hoppers and police,
they just let him be.

796
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,103
Was a good thing, huh ?

797
01:01:15,312 --> 01:01:16,588
I'm just sayin'.

798
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:20,218
You probly don't know,
but it's rough out there, baby.

799
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:24,328
Cops be back bangin'on you.
Hoppers be messin' with you.

800
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:29,509
Thank you.

801
01:01:30,977 --> 01:01:31,622
Aw, shit.

802
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:33,956
That's a dime here.
That's a seed.

803
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:37,065
Come on, boy.
